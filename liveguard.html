                <h4 class="section-desc" id="no-text-indent">Although this project is near completion, there are still grounds left to cover in the design iteration cycle. There are still several updates to be made from the <b>user tests</b>. My next steps will definitely include conducting more <b>user tests</b>, as well as exploring more <b>edge cases</b> and expanding the <b>design system</b>.
                    <br>
                    <span></span>
                    As my first freelance end-to-end project, I learned so, so much from the design process. Factors such as <b>limited resources</b> and <b>unclear guidelines</b> impacted the project far more than anticipated. I now have a better grasp on <b>balancing the resources</b> available with the MVP scope. If I was supposed to do this project again, I think I would emphasize on the importance of defining a <b>realistic scope</b> for the project earlier on, and spend more time discussing the limits with the team. While we may use the first iteration’s features in the future, it isn’t guaranteed.
                    <br>
                    <span></span>
                    Overall, LiveGuard is an awesome startup filled with a lot of cool people, please look forward to its launch in the future!
