                <h4 class="section-desc">The current system of <b>locating classrooms</b> at the university often requires the usage of static, inconspicuous floor plans, whose <b>unintuitive nature</b> leads to students getting lost and wasting time using <b>inefficient</b> routes.</h4>

                <h4 class="section-desc">There are so, so many pain points. Users often use applications such as Google Maps to locate a building. However, location markers are often placed in the middle of a building which may not lead users to a particular entrance or the closest one to their desired room, especially in larger, more complex buildings. Upon entry of a building, to locate a room, users typically have to read <b>static, confusing floor plans</b> scattered inside. For convenience, there are several food vendors run by UWaterloo on campus. However, most <b>lack reviews</b> and their restaurant descriptions are <b>biased</b> for advertisement purposes.</h4>

There are areas on campus which are <b>not wheelchair-accessible,</b> but widely used map applications do not have a feature which filters routes down based on accessibility needs or weather conditions.</h4>

                    If I could improve on anything next time, it would be to create more components so the app could be more cohesive to a new user. The process was very smooth sailing otherwise- considering it was due the week before finals, I'm very pleased with the result.
